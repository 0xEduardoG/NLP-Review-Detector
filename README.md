# Fake Review Detector

## Overview

    Facts about online commerce, whenever we buy online, we always check the reviews to see what others are saying about it, but did you know that around 40% of reviews online are fake? And out of those, 90% are just computer or AI generated, created to convince you about the product or service that you're browsing, instead of giving you information about other buyers.

    
    We recently created a web browser extension and mobile app called "REALview", which is designed for the user to input the product that they're interested in and filter out all the reviews that are computer or AI generated, showing only the ones written by actual people.
    
    With our Natural Processing language model, we're able to improve the shopping experience of our users, making the reviews more trustworthy and important, since customers have the certainty that they're reading form others who are sharing their experience with it.

    ## Data Sources

    For this model, we're using a data source from OSF.IO, that consist of over 40.000 different reviews, both human made and computer generated.

    ## Technical approach

    For this project, we focus on creating the best possible model to detect fake reviews, our approach consist of using 5 different models for classification with it's corresponding hyper parameter tuning. Then create different ensemble methods to try to improve our accuracy on the data set, after that, we proceed to apply some neural networks algorithms to our data set to further improve our results.
